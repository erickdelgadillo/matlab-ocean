# Published temporal profile workflow

This directory contains the historical MATLAB Live Scripts and exact input
workbooks used to generate the environmental profile panels in Supplementary
Figures 1 and 2 of the associated Frontiers in Marine Science article.

## Figure mapping

| Figure | Station | Live script | Input | Exported panels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Supplementary Figure 1 | Offshore (Station 3) | `station3_ctd.mlx` | `S3_CTD.xlsx` | Temperature, salinity, fluorescence, turbidity, and PAR |
| Supplementary Figure 1 | Coast (Station 6) | `station6_ctd.mlx` | `S6_CTD.xlsx` | Temperature, salinity, fluorescence, turbidity, and PAR |
| Supplementary Figure 2 | Offshore (Station 3) | `station3_nutrients.mlx` | `S3_Metadata.xlsx` | NO2, NO3, NH4, TIN, PO4, SiO2, and chlorophyll-a |
| Supplementary Figure 2 | Coast (Station 6) | `station6_nutrients.mlx` | `S6_Metadata.xlsx` | NO2, NO3, NH4, TIN, PO4, SiO2, and chlorophyll-a |

The scripts export individual seasonal panels. The final multipanel figures
were assembled separately for publication.

## Run

From the repository root in MATLAB:

```matlab
repoRoot = pwd;
addpath(fullfile(repoRoot, 'third_party'));
cd(fullfile(repoRoot, 'live_scripts', 'temporal'));
```

Open each `.mlx` file and select **Run**. The generated PNG files are written
to this directory and ignored by Git.

## Input checksums

The checksums preserve traceability to the selected files in the historical
ENVISION working directory.

```

The four live scripts also match their selected historical counterparts byte
for byte. File modification dates were not used as the sole selection criterion
because the archive was migrated in 2025; selection was based on script names,
input references, exported panel names, and visual correspondence with the final
supplementary PDF.
