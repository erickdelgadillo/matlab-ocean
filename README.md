# Coastal-upwelling-bacterioplankton

Curated MATLAB and R code used to generate oceanographic profiles, main
figures, supplementary figures, and correction analyses associated with
**“Coastal upwelling systems as dynamic mosaics of bacterioplankton functional
specialization.”**

The 2026 correction notice replaces Supplementary Figures 3 and 5. The MATLAB
workflows documented here correspond to Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 and are
not identified as affected by that correction.

## Published MATLAB workflow

The final article material was compared with the historical ENVISION working
directory to identify the scripts that generated the published CTD and nutrient
profile panels.

| Published figure | Content | Live scripts | Input workbooks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Supplementary Figure 1 | Temperature, PAR, chlorophyll-a, salinity, and turbidity profiles | `station3_ctd.mlx`, `station6_ctd.mlx` | `S3_CTD.xlsx`, `S6_CTD.xlsx` |
| Supplementary Figure 2 | Ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, silicate, and phosphate profiles | `station3_nutrients.mlx`, `station6_nutrients.mlx` | `S3_Metadata.xlsx`, `S6_Metadata.xlsx` |

Station 3 is the offshore station and Station 6 is the coastal station. The
four input workbooks are kept next to the live scripts because the historical
code reads them by relative filename. Checksums and a more detailed mapping are
available in [`live_scripts/temporal/README.md`](live_scripts/temporal/README.md).
Files outside this table are retained as historical or exploratory material and
are not claimed to reproduce figures from the article.

## Published R workflow

The final R materials were also traced through the historical ENVISION
directory. Three notebooks are retained:

| Notebook | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `publication_figures.Rmd` | Revised main workflow for environmental, community, transcriptomic, gene-abundance, ratio, and supplementary plots |
| `figure2_rda.Rmd` | Final RDA panels B–D for Figure 2 |
| `correction_2026.Rmd` | Corrected phosphorus and `pstS` ratio analysis from 2026 |

The notebooks and their 19 compact CSV inputs are under [`r_analysis/`](r_analysis/README.md).
Large processed objects remain excluded from Git and are documented there. A
complete local copy of the recovered ENVISION workspace is kept under the
ignored `local_archive/ENVISION/` directory.

A code-only snapshot of all 10 validated ENVISION R Markdown documents and the
two shared R utilities is published under
[`r_analysis/validated_workspace/`](r_analysis/validated_workspace/README.md).
It intentionally excludes data files and generated figures.

## Running the published workflow

Start MATLAB in the repository root and prepare the historical dependency path:

```matlab
repoRoot = pwd;
addpath(fullfile(repoRoot, 'third_party'));
cd(fullfile(repoRoot, 'live_scripts', 'temporal'));
```

Open and run the four live scripts listed above. They read the included Excel
workbooks and export the individual panels as 300 dpi PNG files. Generated PNG
files are intentionally ignored by Git.

## Data availability

The four compact oceanographic workbooks required by the published MATLAB
workflow and the 19 compact CSV inputs used by the selected R notebooks are
included. Large processed objects, other raw tables, generated figures, and
the full historical working directory remain excluded from Git.

The sequence data cited by the article are available from the European
Nucleotide Archive under:

- `PRJEB36188` — 16S rRNA gene sequences
- `PRJEB36099` — 18S rRNA gene sequences
- `PRJEB36728` (`ERS5513557`–`ERS5513582`) — metatranscriptomes

See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for provenance and scope notes.

## Requirements and validation status

The published MATLAB live scripts use `xlsread`, `gridfit`, and
`exportgraphics`. `gridfit` is retained under `third_party/` with its original
attribution. The R package requirements are listed in
[`r_analysis/README.md`](r_analysis/README.md) and in the setup chunk of the
main notebook.

The selected live scripts match the historical files byte for byte, their input
schemas were inspected, and their output names and panel contents were matched
to the final supplementary figures. End-to-end execution has not yet been
repeated because MATLAB is not installed in the current curation environment.
The selected R notebooks have been syntax-checked, the 2026 correction notebook
was rerun successfully, and the restored historical main workflow completed
end to end with the recovered local inputs. The RDA workflow was also validated
with a reduced permutation count; its production default remains 999.
